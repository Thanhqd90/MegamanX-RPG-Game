Developer comments

The Megaman X series is my favorite series of all time and holds a very special place to me in my heart.  
I was formerly a Megaman X4 speed runner and I also played Marvel vs. Capcom 3 
competitively as a Zero main for several years.  The base instructions featured a Star Wars themed RPG game but I did 
not see Star Wars so I wanted to make the project something that feels more meaningful to me.  I have a combination of Marvel vs. Capcom
and the X series within my front end design.  This game was very challenging to complete, over 35 hours went into this and I still have other
things I would like to do in order to make the game more interactive.  This game required us to combined a lot of different basic concepts
and a lot of additional learning of different jQuery methods and becoming more familiar with the library in order to create a functioning
game.
